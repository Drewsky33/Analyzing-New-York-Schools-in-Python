# Analyzing-New-York-Schools-in-Python

## Project Overview

This guided project is an exploratory analysis on the SAT and how schools in New York performed on it. The SAT has been a controversial topic and has left many to wonder whether or not it is a reliable indicator of student success in High School, college, and beyond. Some believe the test is racially biased, while others believe it is economically biased, some say that it is gender biased. This analysis explores those relationships.

#### Project Steps

- Load data into a dictionary from [NYC Open Data](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/browse?category=Education)
- Clean and Merge Data
- Perform Analysis
- Present Findings

The goal of the project is to answer the following questions:
- Do certain demographics perform better on the SAT?
- Do certain genders perform better on the SAT?
- Which boroughs of New York perform better on the SAT?
- Why do students struggle on the SAT?
- Is taking AP classes an indicator of SAT success?
